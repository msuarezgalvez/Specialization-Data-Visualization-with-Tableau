# Week 4

Now, you will create the final deliverable for Sylvia to present your analysis to company stakeholders. Sylvia will ultimately be presenting these findings both on handouts as a single-frame visualization (optional activity), and in a multi-slide Story Points presentation to board members. The single-frame visualization will be included on hand-outs in
the board meeting.
