# Week 4

we have the data pre-processed, we are ready to roll up our sleeves and begin exploring the data in earnest.  In this milestone you will use the skills that you have learned in the specialization to perform exploratory analysis of your data. You will identify key metrics in the data and create KPIs to track those metrics. We will use those KPIs to create dashboards that allow for comparative views and “brushing and linking” of the data. This will allow us to begin to think about the proper context of developing an explanatory analysis that will form the basis for the remaining milestones.  

Remember that at this point, your design decisions should be made to facilitate exploration of the data, so be sure your KPIs and worksheets demonstrate the visual and cognitive design principles learned in throughout the Specialization. In particular,  and make use of advanced features like hierarchies, actions, filters and parameters.

## Why are these KPIs key to answering your business question or achieving your project goals? What specific insight did these KPIs or worksheets provide you?
These KPI's are essential to maintain control and visualization of the factors and methods of going to market of the company's products. The specific information they provided were high priority KPIs and high priority indicators that allow the monitoring of different products, specifically tablets of different brands.

## How does your dashboard or worksheet(s) exemplify use of at least one pre-attentive attribute?
Simplicity is emphasized in addition to using colors that are not too flashy but trying to be characterized by being visually attractive thanks to some details such as eliminating grids or making a significant contrast of colors with the help of the gray background with respect to the colors chosen in the graphics used.


## How does your dashboard or worksheet(s) exemplify use of at least one of the following KPI principles?
For this case, the characteristics chosen would be relevance and simplicity.

## Do these worksheets meet the needs of your intended audience as-is? How might they need to be changed before ultimately being presented?
Although the final work of this course will be much more complete than what is currently seen, this work could be improved by adding more graphics that allow to relate the KPIs with the main elements, that is, of the most important factors that are considered to be carried out. carry out the objective that has been proposed in this project.
