# Week 5

In this Milestone, you will pivot from a mindset of exploratory analysis to one of explanatory analysis. By now you have explored key elements of your data using KPI techniques, and you should have some insights or answers to present. 
Here is where we will give structure to those insights and answers in a way that creates a clear and compelling presentation of your findings. As mentioned previously, you have two options for your final deliverable - either a single-frame viz (or infographic), or a multi-frame data story using Story Points. 
To make this decision, you will need to consult your project proposal and your persona document from Milestone 1 and decide which of these formats will best suit the needs of your audience.
