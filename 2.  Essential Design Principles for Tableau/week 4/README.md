The Sales - Superstore dataset contains detailed information about your company’s sales. Your manager, Sylvia, has made a decision to cut the three worst performing sub-categories in their region in terms of Sales. To do this, she has asked you to create one data visualization that will identify which three sub-categories are the worst performers by region, and show how much worse they perform than other sub-categories. Sylvia will use this visualization to inform which product categories to cut, and in which regions.

For this assignment, you will first review the persona document for Sylvia to gain an understanding of her needs, goals and abilities. You will then create a visualization from the Sales - Superstore data set that shows the worst performing sub-categories in each region, and how those worst performers compare to other sub-categories in that region. You must also identify the three worst performing sub-categories overall. 

Your visualization must demonstrate proper use of the design principles used in this course, specifically: “pop-out” or “pre-attentive” attributes, Gestalt Principles, cognitive load and clutter, and static or interactive format. You will be asked to explain how your design choices are a good match for Sylvia and how they will address her needs and goals in this context.
